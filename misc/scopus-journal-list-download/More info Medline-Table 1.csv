"Scopus has a 100% overlap with Medline titles. The majority of those titles are also received via the publisher, however, approximately 20% of the Medline titles are fed directly from Medline into Scopus. As a result, these titles often have a delay in being loaded into Scopus, do not contain references and only the first author affiliation is available. ",,,,
